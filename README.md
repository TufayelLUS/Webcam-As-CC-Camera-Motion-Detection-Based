# Webcam As CC Camera Motion Detection Based
This piece of code is based on opencv that detects human movement within the camera frame, just like a CC camera, and to save memory, it records only the movement situation. Make your webcam a cc camera in no time with this!

# Intro
This simple tool watches your webcam and **automatically records when it detects human movement**. It captures:

- **5 seconds before movement**
- **Until movement stops**
- **Plus 10 seconds after the last movement**

All recordings are saved in a folder named **videos**. You can customize the time inside the code base settings.
